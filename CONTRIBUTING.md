## Help Getting Started with React Native

The recommendation for getting start is to complete [egghead.io tutorial](https://egghead.io/series/react-native-fundamentals) by Tyler McGinnis. This should be enough to get an understanding of the React Native framework (iOS or Android experience is not neccesary).

After completion of that tutorial set up a pairing session with [@bdougie](https://github.com/bdougie) to get the lay of the land.
