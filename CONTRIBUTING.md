## Getting Started

The best way to get started is to follow these instructions:

1. Get the app up and running on your machine with the simulator (follow the instructions in the README)
2. Pick an issue with the `help-wanted` label. [Click here to see those issues.](https://github.com/Bloc/Messenger/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
3. Assign the issue to yourself if you intend to work on it
4. Open a pull request and be open to feedback :)

## General Guidelines

- Please submit pull requests that are focused on a single change rather than on multiple unrelated changes 
- Please submit pull requests from descriptively-named branches (for example, `fix-authentication` instead of `foobar`)
- Please [squash all your commits](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git) prior to opening a pull request
- Feel free to solve or contribute to solving any open issues
- Please feel free to open new issues
- Please adhere to all lint rules using [.eslint](https://github.com/Bloc/BlocMessenger/blob/master/.eslintrc)
- Testing is React Native is not as straight forward as it is in React. Tests are encouraged, but not required.

## Help Getting Started with React Native

The recommendation for getting start is to complete this [egghead.io tutorial](https://egghead.io/series/react-native-fundamentals) by Tyler McGinnis. This should be enough to get a good understanding of the React Native framework (iOS or Android experience is not neccesary).

After completing the tutorial, set up a pairing session with [@bdougie](https://github.com/bdougie) to get the lay of the land.
