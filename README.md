# Bloc Messenger

- This should be thought of as an Open Source Project in a Private Repo
- This project is not open to Student contributions at this time

- GitHub will be the platform to [report issues](https://github.com/bdougie/BlocMessenger/issues/new) and bugs (*PRs are welcomed).
- Feature can be requested through the [Github Issue creation](https://github.com/bdougie/BlocMessenger/issues/new) as well.
- Please do not report bugs through the Bloc Platform reporting tools or Phabricator, use GitHub instead. 
- Feel free to reach to the repo @bdougie for questions

```
