- Feature can be requested through the [Github Issue creation](https://github.com/bdougie/BlocMessenger/issues/new) as well.
- Please do not report bugs through the Bloc Platform reporting tools or Phabricator, use GitHub instead.

## Tests

Testing is only limited to Unit tests for now. Consider reading the
  [enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) documentation
  for reference.

```
$ npm test
$ npm run tdd // for test watcher
```

## Building Bloc Messenger for an iOS device

NOTE: This requires a membership to the Apple Developer Program.

If you'd like to run the application on your device, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you're running: `$ react-native start ios`
2. Build a new jsbundle: `$ curl http://localhost:8081/index.ios.bundle -o main.jsbundle`
3. Tweak the `AppDelegate.m` file to use the "OPTION 2" by uncommenting the following line:
  
  ```
  //   jsCodeLocation = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];
  ```

4. Plug in your device
5. Select your device from the build targets:

## Linting

The linter is strict but open to debate. Please open up PR's to the [eslintrc](https://github.com/Bloc/BlocMessenger/blob/master/.eslintrc) to request changes.

```
$ npm install eslint -g
$ eslint
```

## API Endpoints

If you plan to add new features to the Messenger, note that there is documentation for API endpoints open to [Students](http://docs.blocapi.apiary.io/#reference/0/credentials) and [Mentors](https://www.bloc.io/apidoc).
